# ðŸ§® Project 1: Basic Rust Calculator with Solana Token Conversion

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Build a simple **calculator in Rust** that performs basic arithmetic operations (**addition, subtraction, multiplication, division**) and converts the result into a **hypothetical Solana (SOL) token value**.  
This project will help you strengthen your understanding of Rust fundamentals while tying them to a **blockchain context**.

## Example :
    Enter operation (add/sub/mul/div): add

    Enter first number: 5.0

    Enter second number: 3.0

    Result: 8.0

    Equivalent in SOL: 0.08 SOL
    
    Do another calculation? (yes/no): yes
